# Proyecto_final

## Overview

The objective of this project is to apply unsupervised machine learning clusterization with metrics related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) set by the united nations (UN) to be achieved until 2030, between countries. With the clusterization, attributes in common will be stand out so the countries can be identify between each cluster.

* Extract relevant data from the world bank data page
* Match data with ODS # objective 
* Filter the null data
* Interpolate the remain data to complete a 10 years range information for each country/series
* Standarize the information so it could be sumarized and analize by the clusterization model 
* Prepare the data to feed the model frame
* Identify the clusterization 
* Measure and fit to the best model
* Graphic the info in a world map for beter understanding

## Technical Details

## Data Source

The main data source came from the world bank data bank https://databank.worldbank.org/
For this project a total of 262 countries with 61 metrics each and with a period of data from 2005 to 2019 was used.

## Important Details
Further research could be analyse by determin wich country
