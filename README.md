## Overview

The objective of this project is to apply unsupervised machine learning clusterization with the metrics related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) set by the united nations (UN) to be achieved until 2030, between countries.

* Filter the relevant data from the world bank
* Clasify the metrics to the 17 ODS set by the UN
* Prepare the data to feed the model frame
* Identify the clusterization 
* Measure and fit to the best model, if so

## Data Source

The main data source came from the world bank data bank https://databank.worldbank.org/
For this project a total of 262 countries with 61 metrics each and with a period of data from 2005 to 2019 was used.
